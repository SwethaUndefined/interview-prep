// when To Use Pure Components


//Use Pure Components to optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders when props or state haven't changed.
//  This is particularly useful for components that are expensive to re-render or when you have a large list of items
//  that should be rendered only when their underlying data changes.
