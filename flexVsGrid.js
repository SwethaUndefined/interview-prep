// Flexbox vs. CSS Grid: Flexbox is ideal for one-dimensional layouts like rows or columns, while CSS Grid is suitable
// for complex two-dimensional layouts. Flexbox is more suitable for components, while CSS Grid is better for
// overall page layouts.

//Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layouts, meaning it deals with either rows or columns, but not both simultaneously.
//CSS Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts, meaning it handles both rows and columns simultaneously.
//  It allows for more complex layouts that can span both directions.
