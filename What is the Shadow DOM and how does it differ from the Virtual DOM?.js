//What is the Shadow DOM and how does it differ from the Virtual DOM?

// Answer:

// "The Shadow DOM is a technology that allows web developers to create components with their own isolated DOM and CSS. 
// This means the styles and structure of these components won't affect the rest of the page, and vice versa.

// The Virtual DOM, on the other hand, is used in libraries like React to improve performance.
//  It's an in-memory representation of the actual DOM. When something changes, the Virtual DOM updates first, 
// and then only the differences are applied to the real DOM, making updates more efficient.

// In short, the Shadow DOM is about encapsulation and isolation, while the Virtual DOM is about efficient updates
//  and performance."
