// Patch is http method, this will update the data partially. Like it will update the specific fields which is actually needed
// instead of updating the entire thing unwantedly


//Difference b/w put and patch:

// PATCH updates only the specified fields of a resource.
// PUT replaces the entire resource with the new data.
