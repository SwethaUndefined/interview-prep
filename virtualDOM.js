//Virtual DOM is concept in react.js and it is used for performance optimization. It is light weight copy of the 
//real dom. when react state changes , react creates the new DOM and compares that with previous one. This process
//is called diffing. So it will only update the changes to the actual DOM. Helps for reducing load time
