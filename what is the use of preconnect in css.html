<!-- The preconnect directive in CSS is used to optimize the loading performance of a webpage by establishing early 
connections to external origins before resources from those origins are actually requested.
This is particularly useful for reducing latency when your page makes requests to external domains. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Document</title>
  <!-- Use preconnect to establish early connections -->
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://example.com">
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://cdn.example.com">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>

<!-- Reduced Latency: By establishing connections earlier, it can reduce the time it takes for resources to start loading.
Improved Performance: Especially useful for resources that are critical to the page, such as fonts, scripts, 
or stylesheets hosted on third-party domains.
In summary, preconnect can help improve the loading speed of your webpage by reducing the time required to 
establish network connections to external resources -->
