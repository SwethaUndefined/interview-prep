// why react does not recoginize the Search engine optimization?


// Because react is a single page application(index.html) and it is dynamically rendering so that doesnt recoginize 
// the Search engine optimization
// This is why React applications need additional strategies like server-side rendering (SSR) with frameworks like Next.js, static site generation (SSG), 
// or prerendering to improve their SEO
