// Debounce: Waits until the event has stopped firing for a specified delay before executing the function. 
// This ensures that the function is called once after the delay period following the last event.


// Throttle: Ensures that the function is called at regular intervals, regardless of how many times the event fires.
//  This means the function will execute immediately and then once per interval.
