<!-- em

Definition: The em unit is relative to the font size of its parent element.
Use Case: It scales based on the font size of the element or its parent, making it useful for scaling text and 
layout relative to its context.
Example: If a parent element's font size is 16px, 1em in a child element will also be 16px. 
If the child element has 2em, it will be 32px. -->


<!-- rem

Definition: The rem unit stands for "root em" and is relative to the font size of the root element (<html>).
Use Case: It scales based on the root font size, making it useful for consistent sizing across the entire page.
Example: If the root element's font size is 16px, 1rem will always be 16px, no matter where it's used. -->

<!-- Key Difference:
em is relative to the parent element's font size.
rem is relative to the root element's font size. -->
