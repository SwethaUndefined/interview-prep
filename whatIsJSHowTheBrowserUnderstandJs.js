//JavaScript is the language browsers use to make websites interactive.
//When a browser loads a web page, it reads through the HTML to identify JavaScript code enclosed within <script> tags.
//  It then interprets this code by breaking it down into tokens, checking its syntax, and converting it into
//  executable instructions.
