// 1.Loading Model: SPA loads content dynamically within the same page, while MPA loads new pages from the server.
// 2. User Experience: SPA provides a smoother and faster user experience since it avoids full-page reloads, whereas
//  MPA may feel slower due to frequent page loads.
// 3. Development Approach: SPA often requires a JavaScript framework for client-side rendering, whereas MPA uses 
// server-side rendering for each page.
